    <section class="about-me-1">
      I have many interests and passions, even those that are not tech-related.
      I am an avid musician who plays bass guitar, as well as photographer.
      Regarding tech, personally I have always been a big fan since I started
      using the internet at a young age. My preference vs. front end or back end goes to back end, however I am planning to commit to fullstack development. C++ is the language I intend to learn after my class has ended.</section>
